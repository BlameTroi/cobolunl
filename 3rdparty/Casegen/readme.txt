-------------------------

Welcome to this FREE COBOL CD from Casegen Systems Ltd.

We hope you enjoy using this software and that it will extend
your COBOL experience into the Windows GUI environment. 

This CD comes complete with the Fujitsu 32-bit COBOL Compiler.

These products must be installed on Windows 95 or NT (4.0),
(or above).  Casegen COBOL for Windows runs best on monitors with
at least 800 x 600 resolution and High Color (16 bit) or above. 

Please review the "Getting Started" manual on the "Docs" directory 
on this CD in Microsoft Word 6 format, which you may want to print.
If you do not have Microsoft Word, you can use Wordpad to view the 
file.

In the Samples folder, there are lots of programs - just
double-click in Windows Explorer after you have installed both products
for a quick start!

We have also included a PowerPoint presentation if you are interested
in IBM CICS Client/Server distributed development.  There are notes
to accompany the presentation in the "Docs" folder on the CD.
