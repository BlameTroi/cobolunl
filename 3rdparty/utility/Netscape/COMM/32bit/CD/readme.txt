               Installation Instructions 

================================================================== 

* Installation 

 To run the 32-bit Communicator, you MUST have a 32-bit TCP/IP stack. 
 Both Windows 95 and Windows NT provide built-in 32-bit TCP/IP 
 stacks that you can set up.  You can also get (32-bit) TCP/IP 
 software from third-party vendors like Trumpet Software, 
 and Ftp Software. 

 To obtain a copy of Netscape Communicator, download one of the 
 self-extracting executable files into a temporary directory. 

   For 32-bit : 
   cb32e404.exe (standard installation) 
   cc32e404.exe (includes Netscape Conference and multimedia plug-ins) 

 To run the 16-bit Communicator, you MUST have a 16-bit TCP/IP stack. 
 You can get (16-bit) TCP/IP software from third party vendors like 
 Trumpet Software and Ftp Software. 

 To obtain a copy of Netscape Communicator, download one of the 
 self-extracting executable files into a temporary directory. 

   For 16-bit : 
   cb16e404.exe (standard installation) 
   cc16e404.exe (includes Netscape Conference and multimedia plug-ins) 

 Double-click on the self-extracting file to start the installation 
 process automatically. 


* Windows 95 users, if you are using any versions prior to this 
release, you will get multiple uninstall entries in your 
Add/Remove program.  If you prefer not having multiple 
entries, you should do an uninstall to remove your previous 
version of Communicator before you install the new release. 

* The Netscape Audio Plug-in will only work if you have a sound 
card installed and configured properly.  It will not work 
with the PC speaker driver. Please check your sound card manual 
to configure the sound card. 

* If you had previously installed CoolTalk Watchdog, then you must 
uninstall the version you have and reboot your machine before 
installing the latest version.  You might experience some 
problems running Cooltalk with Matrox MGA Millennium graphic 
adapters using early Windows 95 drivers. Make sure that you are 
running version 2.22.039 or later. 

* If you have deinstalled an earlier version of Communicator, reboot 
your system before installing another copy of Communicator. Files 
might exist that cannot be deleted until your system is rebooted.
