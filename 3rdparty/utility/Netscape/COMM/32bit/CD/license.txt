THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF

	NETSCAPE CLIENT SOFTWARE END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
	      REDISTRIBUTION OR RENTAL NOT PERMITTED

This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of 
the accompanying Netscape client software product(s) (the 
"Software"). Any third party software that is provided with the 
Software with such third party's license agreement (in either 
electronic or printed form) is included for use at your option. 
If you choose to use such software, then such use shall be governed
by such third party's license agreement and not by this Agreement.
As used in this Agreement, for residents of Europe, the Middle East 
and Africa, "Netscape" shall mean Netscape Communications Ireland 
Limited; for residents of Japan, "Netscape" shall mean Netscape 
Communications (Japan), Ltd.; for residents of all other countries,
"Netscape" shall mean Netscape Communications Corporation. For 
purposes of this Agreement, "Licensor" shall be defined as follows:
If you have acquired a third party product or service and such product 
or service included the Software, then such third party shall be the 
Licensor. Otherwise, Netscape shall be the Licensor.

LICENSE GRANT. Licensor grants you a non-exclusive and non-transferable
license to use the Software and accompanying documentation
("Documentation"), subject to the limitations below. If the Software is
Netscape Navigator, Netscape Navigator Gold or Netscape Communicator 
Standard Edition software ("Standard Software"), or it is Netscape 
Communicator Professional Edition software which you are using for a 
limited time for the purpose of evaluating whether to purchase an 
ongoing license to that product ("Evaluation Software"), there is no 
fee for this license. The evaluation period for use of Evaluation 
Software by or on behalf of a commercial entity is limited to ninety
(90) days; evaluation use by others is not subject to this ninety (90)
day limit. If the Software is any Netscape client software product 
other than Standard Software or Evaluation Software, such as Netscape 
Communicator Professional Edition, Netscape Communicator Internet 
Access Edition, Netscape Communicator Deluxe Edition, or Netscape 
Publishing Suite ("Professional Software"), this license grant is 
subject to the payment of applicable license fees. Unless you have 
purchased a subscription for the Software, the license granted under
this Agreement does not grant you any right to any enhancement or
update to the Software. If you are using Standard Software or 
Evaluation Software, you are not entitled to hard-copy documentation, 
support or telephone assistance unless the entity from which you 
received Standard Software provides you with support. In addition, if 
the Software was included with a third party product or service, you
may use the Software only with such product or service.

LIMITATIONS ON USE.

With respect to all Software, you may not:

·	modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble 
(except and solely to the extent an applicable statute expressly and 
specifically prohibits such restrictions), or create derivative works
based on the Software;

·	rent, lease, grant a security interest in, or otherwise
transfer rights to the Software; or

·	remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other
proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in the Software, or in
copies you have made of the Software.

With respect to Professional Software, the following additional 
restrictions apply. You may only:

·	use the Professional Software on a single computer, except that
(i) it may also be used on a second computer if only one (1) copy is 
used at a time, and (ii) if the Professional Software is Netscape 
Communicator Professional Edition and was licensed by a company or 
organization for use by an employee, then you may allow that employee
to use a copy of Netscape Communicator Professional Edition at home. 
The home copy can either be copied from the employee's computer at work
or downloaded from the Netscape web site at no cost. You may not 
duplicate the Documentation for home users, and no technical assistance
will be provided for home use;

·	use the Professional Software on a network if a licensed copy 
of the Professional Software has been acquired for each person 
permitted to access the Professional Software through the network;

·	make a single copy of the Professional Software for archival 
purposes, and the copy must contain all of the original Professional 
Software's proprietary notices; and

·	if you have purchased a license for multiple copies of the 
Professional Software, make the total number of copies of the 
Professional Software (but not the Documentation) stated on the packing
slip(s), invoice(s), or Certificate(s) of Authenticity, provided any 
copy must contain all of the original Professional Software's 
proprietary notices. The number of copies on the packing slip(s), 
invoice(s), or Certificate(s) of Authenticity is the total number of 
copies that may be made for all platforms. Additional copies of 
Documentation may be purchased from Licensor.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY FOR STANDARD AND EVALUATION SOFTWARE.  
Standard Software and Evaluation Software are provided on an "AS IS" 
basis, without warranty of any kind, including without limitation the 
warranties that the Standard Software and Evaluation Software are free
of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or 
non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of 
the Standard Software and Evaluation Software is borne by you. Should 
the Standard Software or Evaluation Software prove defective in any
respect, you and not Licensor or its suppliers assume the entire cost 
of any service and repair. In addition, the security mechanisms 
implemented by the Standard Software and Evaluation Software have 
inherent limitations, and you must determine that the Standard Software
and Evaluation Software sufficiently meet your requirements. This 
disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this Agreement.
No use of the Standard Software or Evaluation Software is authorized 
hereunder except under this Disclaimer.

LIMITED WARRANTY FOR PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE.  If 
license fees have been paid, Licensor warrants that for a period 
of ninety (90) days from the date of acquisition, the Professional 
Software, if operated as directed, will substantially achieve the 
functionality described in the Documentation. Licensor does not 
warrant, however, that your use of the Professional Software will be 
uninterrupted or that the operation of the Professional Software will 
be error-free or secure. In addition, the security mechanisms 
implemented by the Professional Software have inherent limitations, 
and you must determine that the Professional Software sufficiently 
meets your requirements. Licensor also warrants that the media 
containing the Professional Software, if provided by Licensor, is 
free from defects in material and workmanship and will so remain for 
ninety (90) days from the date you acquired the Professional Software.
Licensor's sole liability for any breach of this warranty shall be, 
in Licensor's sole discretion: (i) to replace your defective media or
Professional Software; or (ii) to advise you how to achieve 
substantially the same functionality with the Professional Software as 
described in the Documentation through a procedure different from that
set forth in the Documentation; or (iii) for individual consumers, if
the above remedies are impracticable, to refund the license fee you 
paid for the Professional Software. Repaired, corrected, or replaced
Professional Software and Documentation shall be covered by this 
limited warranty for the period remaining under the warranty that 
covered the original Professional Software, or if longer, for thirty 
(30) days after the date (a) of delivery to you of the repaired or 
replaced Professional Software, or (b) Licensor advised you how to 
operate the Professional Software so as to achieve substantially the
same functionality described in the Documentation.

Only if you inform Licensor of your problem with the Professional
Software during the applicable warranty period and provide evidence 
of the date you purchased a license to the Professional Software will
Licensor be obligated to honor this warranty. Licensor will use 
reasonable commercial efforts to repair, replace, advise or, for 
individual consumers, refund pursuant to the foregoing warranty 
within thirty (30) days of being so notified.

If any modifications are made to the Professional Software by you 
during the warranty period; if the media is subjected to accident,
abuse, or improper use; or if you violate the terms of this Agreement, 
then this warranty shall immediately terminate. This warranty shall not
apply if the Professional Software is used on or in conjunction with 
hardware or software other than the unmodified version of hardware and 
software with which the Professional Software was intended to be used 
as described in the Documentation.

THIS IS A LIMITED WARRANTY, AND IT IS THE ONLY WARRANTY MADE BY
LICENSOR OR ITS SUPPLIERS. LICENSOR MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES, 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES' RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER 
STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, 
THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL
BE LIMITED TO THE ABOVE LIMITED WARRANTY PERIOD. MOREOVER, 
IN NO EVENT WILL WARRANTIES PROVIDED BY LAW, IF ANY, APPLY 
UNLESS THEY ARE REQUIRED TO APPLY BY STATUTE NOTWITHSTANDING 
THEIR EXCLUSION BY CONTRACT. NO DEALER, AGENT, OR EMPLOYEE OF 
LICENSOR IS AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ANY MODIFICATIONS, EXTENSIONS, 
OR ADDITIONS TO THIS LIMITED WARRANTY.

ENCRYPTION.  If the Software contains cryptographic features, then you
may wish to obtain a signed digital certificate from a certificate 
authority or a certificate server in order to utilize certain of the 
cryptographic features. You may be charged additional fees for 
certification services. You are responsible for maintaining the 
security of the environment in which the Software is used and the 
integrity of the private key file used with the Software. In addition,
the use of digital certificates is subject to the terms specified by 
the certificate provider, and there are inherent limitations in the 
capabilities of digital certificates. If you are sending or receiving 
digital certificates, you are responsible for familiarizing yourself 
with and evaluating such terms and limitations. If the Software is a 
Netscape product with FORTEZZA, you will also need to obtain PC Card 
Readers and FORTEZZA Crypto Cards to enable the FORTEZZA features.

TITLE.  Title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in
the Software and Documentation shall remain in Netscape and/or its
suppliers. You acknowledge such ownership and intellectual property 
rights and will not take any action to jeopardize, limit or interfere 
in any manner with Netscape's or its suppliers' ownership of or rights
with respect to the Software and Documentation. The Software and 
Documentation are protected by copyright and other intellectual 
property laws and by international treaties. Title and related rights 
in the content accessed through the Software is the property of the 
applicable content owner and is protected by applicable law. The 
license granted under this Agreement gives you no rights to such 
content.

TERMINATION.  This Agreement and the license granted hereunder will 
terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the limitations
described herein. Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of 
the Software and Documentation. Your obligations to pay accrued charges
and fees shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

EXPORT CONTROLS.  None of the Software or underlying information or 
technology may be downloaded or otherwise exported or reexported (i) 
into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, North
Korea, Iran, Syria or any other country to which the U.S. has
embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's
list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce 
Department's Table of Denial Orders. By downloading or using the 
Software, you are agreeing to the foregoing and you are representing 
and warranting that you are not located in, under the control of, or a
national or resident of any such country or on any such list. In 
addition, you are responsible for complying with any local laws in
your jurisdiction which may impact your right to import, export or 
use the Software, and you represent that you have complied with any 
regulations or registration procedures required by applicable law to
make this license enforceable.

If the Software is identified as a not-for-export product (for example,
on the box, media or in the installation process), then, unless you 
have an exemption from the United States Department of State, the 
following applies: EXCEPT FOR EXPORT TO CANADA FOR USE IN 
CANADA BY CANADIAN CITIZENS, THE SOFTWARE AND ANY UNDERLYING
TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE EXPORTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OR TO
ANY FOREIGN ENTITY OR "FOREIGN PERSON" AS DEFINED BY U.S. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
ANYONE WHO IS NOT A CITIZEN, NATIONAL OR LAWFUL PERMANENT 
RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE 
SOFTWARE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE FOREGOING AND YOU ARE 
WARRANTING THAT YOU ARE NOT A "FOREIGN PERSON" OR UNDER THE 
CONTROL OF A "FOREIGN PERSON." 

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND 
UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT, CONTRACT, OR 
OTHERWISE, SHALL LICENSOR OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR RESELLERS
BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS 
OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION,
OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES. IN 
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN 
EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT LICENSOR RECEIVED FROM YOU FOR A
LICENSE TO THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF LICENSOR SHALL HAVE 
BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR 
FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. THIS LIMITATION OF 
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR 
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM LICENSOR'S NEGLIGENCE 
TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. 
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION 
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.  The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not
designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line
control equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe 
performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft 
navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life
support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of the
Software could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe 
physical or environmental damage ("High Risk Activities"). 
Accordingly, Licensor and its suppliers specifically disclaim any
express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities.

MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement represents the complete agreement 
concerning the license granted hereunder and may be amended only by a
writing executed by both parties. THE ACCEPTANCE OF ANY PURCHASE ORDER
PLACED BY YOU IS EXPRESSLY MADE CONDITIONAL ON YOUR ASSENT TO THE 
TERMS SET FORTH HEREIN, AND NOT THOSE IN YOUR PURCHASE ORDER. 
If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, 
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to 
make it enforceable. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes 
relating to this Agreement (excepting any dispute relating to
intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding 
arbitration in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of
JAMS/EndDispute, with the losing party paying all costs of 
arbitration. This Agreement shall be governed by California law, 
excluding conflict of law provisions (except to the extent applicable 
law, if any, provides otherwise). The application of the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods 
is expressly excluded.

U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.  The Software is a "commercial item," as 
that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of 
"commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software 
documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 
227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End 
Users acquire the Software with only those rights set forth herein.
