PLEASE READ THE README.TXT in the Manuals directory for an explanation of how to install the 
COBOL Cartridge for Oracle's Web Application Server.

You should also be warned that the documentation for the COBOL Cartridge is for Fujitsu COBOL 
V4.  Unfortunately V4 is still in Beta, so V3 is on the CD. Because of this you will not be able to
use the debugger.  If you are interested in upgrading to V4, please take a look at Fujitsu Software's
web site:
http://www.adtools.com
Upgrade information will be available there.

You will need the Fujitsu COBOL Enterprise Serial Number to install this software.
It is:

103-2001-1699-03811-00095

Don't lose this number, you must use it every time you install this software or when calling technical support.

Thanks.
