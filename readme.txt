	-  Author's source code for any of the chapters that contained code

Are located in the directory titled SOURCE.   When Windows Explorer copies files from the CD-ROM to the hard drive, the read-only attribute is set.  Remove the read only attribute by selecting the file(s). Right-click and select Properties.  Uncheck the Read-only box and click on Apply and then OK.

All the source code is also included in a file called source.zip in the SOURCE directory.

Troubleshooting Common Problems

The usual cause of the CD-ROM not running properly is a damaged or dirty disc. Visually inspect the disc for possible flaws or defects, and clean it properly.  You should also test another CD-ROM in your drive.  This often reveals setup problems that are not disc-specific.  If these procedures fail, you can contact us to get a replacement disc (contact information is at the end of this file).

Depending on the topic and the generally accepted operating system for the topic, the CD-ROM may use long and mixed-case filenames requiring the use of a protected-mode CD-ROM driver. 

The programs run slowly or don't run properly.
Do you have at least the follow amounts of RAM (memory)?

Windows 95:  8 megabytes
Windows NT:  8 megabytes

This may sound familiar, but Windows does not run well on anything less than these amounts. If you only have the minimum amount of RAM, the program may run slowly.

If you only have a single-spin CD-ROM drive, the time to access the programs and source code may be lengthy.


*EarthLink Total Access Software

The online features in this book should work automatically if you already have a browser installed and already have network connections through an online service provider.

If you do not have a browser already, and if you would like to establish a network connection, we have provided the EarthLink Total Access Browser on this CD-ROM.  To access the EarthLink Browser, click "Install Program Group" on the screen that first appears when you load our disk.  Select the "Install EarthLink" icon from the program group and the EarthLink program will walk you through the remainder of the install process.

Note: if you already have a browser installed and a network configuration established, the EarthLink installer will overwrite that configuration.  Be sure that is what you want! If you have no Internet browser currently installed, this will not be a problem.
